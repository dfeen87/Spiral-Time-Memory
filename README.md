## Overview

This repository explores a minimal theoretical framework where **time itself carries intrinsic memory**, encoded in a triadic structure Ψ(t) = (t, φ(t), χ(t)). The proposal offers:

- **Dynamical alternative to the projection postulate** - Measurement emerges from memory stabilization
- **Explicit falsification criteria** - Process-tensor tomography with CP-divisibility tests
- **Experimental discrimination** - Three operational criteria distinguish intrinsic temporal memory from environmental decoherence
- **Reduction to standard QM** - Markovian limit recovered when χ → 0

> This repository is intended as a research and validation framework, not a production physics engine.

**Status**: Theoretical framework with outlined experimental tests. No empirical confirmation yet.

## Core Idea

Standard quantum mechanics treats time as a memoryless parameter. This work asks: *What if temporal dynamics are fundamentally non-Markovian?*

### The Framework

**Standard QM**: Time is an external parameter
```
ẋ(t) = F(x(t))                    # Present determines future
```

**Spiral-Time**: Time is a dynamical state with memory
```
Ψ(t) = t + iφ(t) + jχ(t)         # Triadic structure
ẋ(t) = F(x(t), ∫K(t-τ)x(τ)dτ)    # History matters
         └─ memory kernel
```

**Extended Hilbert Space**:
```
H_ext = H_sys ⊗ H_mem             # Memory sector encodes temporal history
```

Full evolution on H_ext is unitary; traced dynamics on H_sys is non-Markovian.

---

## Key Features

### Measurement Without Collapse

**Problem**: Projection postulate is ad hoc, not derivable from unitary evolution

**Solution**: Measurement = dynamical stabilization of temporal memory
```
χ(t⁺) = χ(t⁻) + Δχ_meas           # Memory sector stabilizes
```

Competing modes lose coherence relative to stabilized memory → effective "collapse" in coarse-grained descriptions while remaining continuous in (|ψ⟩, χ) space.

### Born Rule Emergence

**Standard approach**: |⟨n|ψ⟩|² is axiomatic

**Spiral-Time proposal**: Emerges from time-integrated stability
```
P_n = lim_{T→0} (1/T) ∫_{t₀}^{t₀+T} |ψ_n(t)|² dt → |ψ_n(t₀)|²
```

Compatible with Gleason's theorem via temporal coarse-graining measure.

### Experimental Discrimination from Environmental Decoherence

**Critical question**: How to distinguish from known environmental non-Markovianity?

**Three Operational Criteria**:

| Criterion | Environmental | Spiral-Time |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **1. Memory Kernel** | State-dependent, coupled to bath | State-independent: K(t-τ) only |
| **2. CP-Divisibility** | Violated due to info backflow | Violated structurally in *isolated* systems |
| **3. Process Tensor** | Finite-rank (finite bath) | No finite-rank representation |

**Operational test**: Must satisfy ALL THREE criteria to claim Spiral-Time memory vs environmental effects.

**Sensitivity**: Predicted deviations O(εχ) ∼ 10⁻³–10⁻², within reach of current trapped-ion and superconducting platforms (resolution ~10⁻³).

---

## Falsification Criteria

### Primary Test: Process Tensor Tomography

**Null Hypothesis (Markovian dynamics)**:
```
ℰ_{t:0} = ℰ_{t:s} ∘ ℰ_{s:0}  with ℰ_{t:s} CP for all t ≥ s ≥ 0
```
*(Evolution factorizes into completely positive maps)*

**Spiral-Time Prediction**:
Even after controlling environment and reset protocols, reconstructed process tensors should exhibit:
- Statistically significant deviations from CP-divisible fits
- Outcome probabilities depending on intervention history
- Persistent non-Markovianity under controlled "reset" operations
- State-independent memory kernel K(t-τ)

### Experimental Protocols

#### Protocol A: Reset Test
- **Platform**: NV centers, trapped ions, superconducting qubits
- **Test**: Repeated measure–reset cycles with varied history sequences
- **Expected**: Residual history dependence beyond systematics (state-independent)
- **Falsification**: No history dependence → theory fails

#### Protocol B: Process Tensor Tomography
- **Method**: Reconstruct process over ≥3 time steps with intermediate operations
- **Test**: Does best-fit model require non-factorizing correlations?
- **Critical**: Test with multiple initial states → verify state-independence
- **Falsification**: All processes CP-divisible → theory fails

#### Protocol C: Leggett-Garg Under Interventions
- **Test**: Multi-time correlations with/without engineered memory suppression
- **Expected**: Violations persist under maximal isolation
- **Falsification**: Violations disappear with environment → environmental origin

### Formal Falsification Statement

**The Spiral-Time memory hypothesis is falsified if**:

Under controlled intervention and reset protocols, process-tensor reconstruction yields CP-divisible (Markovian) descriptions for all tested multi-time settings within experimental uncertainty, **OR** if observed non-Markovianity can be reproduced by finite environmental baths (fails discrimination criteria), **AND** no state-independent history-dependent deviations remain beyond systematics.

## Comparison with Standard QM

| Aspect | Standard QM | Spiral-Time |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Time** | External parameter | Dynamical state Ψ = t + iφ + jχ |
| **State Space** | H_sys | H_ext = H_sys ⊗ H_mem |
| **Dynamics** | Markovian (state at t sufficient) | Non-Markovian (history dependence) |
| **Measurement** | Projection postulate (axiom) | Memory stabilization (dynamical) |
| **Born Rule** | Postulate | Temporal coarse-graining (proposal) |
| **Collapse** | Fundamental | Effective (continuous in extended space) |
| **Nonlocality** | Entanglement | Temporal coherence + memory |

**Reduction**: χ → 0 with vanishing memory coupling → standard Markovian QM recovered

## Scope and Limitations

### What This Proposes

- Falsifiable extension of quantum mechanics with specific experimental signatures
- Dynamical mechanism for measurement without projection postulate
- Reduction to standard physics in appropriate limits
- Three-part operational test distinguishing from environmental effects

### What This Does NOT Claim

- To replace quantum field theory (it's an embedding principle)
- That implementations here are unique or canonical (see [`IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md))
- Complete derivation of GR or Standard Model masses (Eqs. 9-10 are effective relations)
- Empirical validation (experimental tests remain to be performed)

### Critical Disclaimers

**All code is illustrative, not definitive**:
- Memory kernel forms (exponential, power-law, Gaussian) are non-unique choices
- Discretization schemes are implementation-dependent
- Parameter values are for demonstration
- See [`IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) for detailed disclaimers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this a new interpretation of quantum mechanics?

No. This is a **structural hypothesis** with **falsifiable predictions**. If process tensors remain CP-divisible under controlled interventions, the theory fails. It's not about interpretation—it's about measurable signatures.

### How does this differ from environmental decoherence?

Three decisive criteria (Section 10 of paper):
1. Memory kernel is **state-independent** (not coupled to ρ(t))
2. CP-divisibility violated in **isolated systems** (no environment needed)
3. Process tensor has **no finite-rank representation** (unbounded temporal correlations)

Standard environmental effects fail at least one of these tests.

### What if all experiments show Markovian dynamics?

Then the theory is **falsified**. This is the point—the framework makes testable predictions that could be wrong.

### Are the code implementations canonical?

**No.** See [`IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md). Memory kernel forms, discretization schemes, and numerical parameters are illustrative choices. Alternative implementations are equally valid.

### Can this replace quantum field theory?

No. It's an **embedding principle** that reduces to standard QFT in the χ → 0 limit. Think of it as a framework that could contain QFT as a special case, not a replacement.

### What about relativity?

Spacetime metric emerges as effective structure (Eq. 9: g_μν ∼ ∂_μΨ · ∂_νΨ). Full GR derivation not claimed—this is a consistency-level relation showing how metric could arise from triadic time-state variations.

## Final Notes

### The Core Claim

**If time carries intrinsic memory**, then:
1. Measurement collapse may be replaced by dynamical memory stabilization
2. Born rule emerges from temporal coarse-graining
3. Multi-time quantum processes will exhibit **state-independent, structurally non-CP-divisible signatures** with no finite-rank representation

### The Test

Perform process tensor tomography under controlled interventions:
- If **all processes are CP-divisible** → theory falsified
- If **non-Markovianity is state-dependent** → environmental origin
- If **reproducible by finite bath** → not Spiral-Time intrinsic memory
- If **all three discrimination criteria pass** → consistent with Spiral-Time

### The Stakes

Either:
- Nature exhibits intrinsic temporal memory → measurement problem resolved dynamically
- Nature is fundamentally Markovian → back to projection postulate

**Let's find out.** 🔬
